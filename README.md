## Support My Advocacy Efforts

> If you like my advocacy, my point-of-view, and my writing, as well as my travel to support local communities, my talks for those communities, and my work with organizations such as [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), [Rebooting the Web of Trust](https://www.WebOfTrust.info), and the [W3C Credentials CG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io), I invite you to sponsor me.
>
> Plus, it's a way to plug into an advocacy network that's not focused on the "big guys". Most of the large corporations have full-time people representing their desires in the various standards orgs, making it hard for small companies and lone developers to fully participate. I work to represent smaller developers in a vendor-neutral, platform-neutral way, helping us all to work together.
>
> You can become a monthly patron on my [GitHub Sponsor Page](https://github.com/sponsors/ChristopherA) for as little as $5 a month; and your contributions will be multipled, as GitHub is matching the first $5,000! Alternatively, you can support my efforts by sponsoring [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com) and our vision of the open web via a monthly [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons) or with Bitcoin via our BTCPay contribution page, [Bitcoin contribution](https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com).
>
> But please don’t think of this as a transaction. It’s an opportunity to advance the open web, digital civil liberties, and human rights together. You get to plug into my various projects, and hopefully will find a way to actively contribute to the digital commons yourself. Let’s collaborate!

## Status & Versioning

This repository are mostly for myself, my professional clients, and my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ChristopherA), as I've not found any bookmarking tool that quite does what I want. The content of my presentations can change regularly, and different presentations will get more focus and attention each week, and thus evolve or even need major refactoring over time.

To make it easier to understand the status of any particular presentation, I use a modified form of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

| Version Revision | Description                                                  | Example |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| **Major**        | A significant reorganization of the previous edition of my presentation, or even refactoring of content out to another presentation and thus a file name change. | 3.0.0   |
| **Minor**        | A significant new edition of this presentation is complete. A number of pages added, maybe minor sections reorganized,  and some old pages filtered out.  I've likely moved on to focusing on a different presentation. <br />If you see that a presentation version was set to 0.3.0  few weeks ago, the presentation is probably pretty current. If that 0.3.0 was a few months or even years ago, I may have added links, but I've not reorganized them or filtered old ones out. | 0.2.0   |
| **Patch**        | A specific version of a presentation, typically because I've presented it in public. Usually be archived by specific commit in this readme. | 0.1.3   |
| **Raw**          | Here is where I vary from classic [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Before I declare a new presentation is sufficient organized and annoted to be called 0.1.0, I will capture my thoughts with little or no review or annotation. I may increment the least significant **Patch** level to let me know that this presentation may be ready for organization, annotation and filtering. | 0.0.1   |
| **Template** | An presentation template | None    |

I only use this versioning approach for the individual presentations. I do not use git release tags as they really don't work well for individual files inside a repo — only for a repo as a whole.
